Description

A website designed to showcase and encourage more downloads for my first game release on the Google Play Store, Space Tracer. Space Tracer is a mobile space action game available on the Google Play Store worldwide. Built using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap along with some Javascript for smooth scroll buttons. Improving upon skills that I learnt from the Tinder Clone website. 

Installation

An IDE that can be used to run HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. Download the Zip folder from Github to your own PC and open the file in the IDE of your choice. Open index.html and then click run live server if you have that extension installed in your IDE.
